# IOT BASED CONTROL & SECURITY SYSTEM WITH REAL-TIME MONITORING & NOTIFICATION



###This project presents a design and prototype implementation of new control & monitoring
system that uses WiFi technology as a network infrastructure connecting its parts. The proposed
system consists of two main components; the first part is the server (web server), which presents
system core that manages, controls, and monitors usersâ€™ area. Users and system administrator can
locally (WLAN) or remotely (Internet) manage and control system. Second part is hardware
interface module, which provides appropriate interface to sensors and actuator of home
automation system. Unlike most of available home automation system in the market the
proposed system is scalable that one server can manage many hardware interface modules as
long as it exists on WiFi network coverage. System supports a wide range of controlling and
monitoring devices like power management components, and security components. The
proposed system is better from the scalability and flexibility with extended features point of view
than the commercially available automation systems.###
