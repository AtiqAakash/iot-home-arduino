# IoT Multipurpose Smart Home/Office/Industrial Automation/Monitoring System

## Overview

This project implements a versatile IoT-based monitoring and automation system that can be deployed in various environments including homes, offices, and industrial settings. It leverages sensors to monitor conditions such as motion, temperature, humidity, flame, and gas presence. The system provides real-time monitoring through a web-based interface accessible from any platform.

## Features

- **Platform Independence**: Browser-based interface accessible from any device.
- **Live Feed**: Real-time monitoring of sensor data.
- **Environment Information**: Displays temperature, humidity, and sensor states.
- **Remote Control**: Ability to control and monitor remotely over the internet.
- **Abnormal Behavior Detection**: Takes action upon detecting abnormal conditions.
- **Notification**: Automatically notifies incidents via email, SMS, and phone calls.

## Components 

- **NodeMCU**: ESP8266-based microcontroller for WiFi connectivity.
- **Arducam OV2640**: Camera module for image capture.
- **MQ5**: Gas sensor for detecting gas presence.
- **IR Flame Sensor**: Infrared sensor for flame detection.
- **DHT22**: Temperature and humidity sensor.
- **PIR Motion Sensor**: Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor for motion detection.
- **SW-420**: Vibration sensor for detecting vibrations.
- **Sim900A mini v4**: GSM module for making phone calls and sending SMS.

## Technologies
